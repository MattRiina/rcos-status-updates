## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In the previous week, I worked to try to setup the shuttle tracker to run on my computer.

> I almost completed the setup but ran into some problems with the configuration file not being read correctly.

> I completed up until step 6 on this GitHub repository setup section: https://github.com/wtg/shuttletracker

## This Week's Plan

> I plan to finish the setup on the shuttle tracker and successfully run it.

> I also plan on familiarizing myself with the project and learning the other softwares I will be using.

## Anything Blocking?

> At runtime, the configuration file is not read correctly, which may be due to the encoding of the file. The file seems to have newline characters of /r/n, where the software is trying to read newlines as \n, which is an indicator that the file is not encoded correctly.
