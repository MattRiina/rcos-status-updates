## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In the previous week, I tried to fix the problem with the reading of the shuttle tracker configuration file.

> Even though I couldn't get my installation to work yet, I was able to help someone else get their's working.

> I completed up until step 11 for Ubuntu on this GitHub repository setup section: https://github.com/wtg/shuttletracker 

## This Week's Plan

> I plan to finish the shuttle tracker setup for Ubuntu and successfully run it.

> I also plan on doing more research on how I can help with my part of the project: ETA.

## Anything Blocking?

> After many different tries of converting each newline ending from \r\n to \n, nothing seemed to change.

> I gave up on trying to get the installation to work for Windows so I started to redo the installation process for Ubuntu.
